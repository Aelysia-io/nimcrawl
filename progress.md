## LLM Integration with Ollama

### Overview
We're using Ollama for local LLM processing to enable advanced features like structured data extraction, content summarization, and semantic analysis without relying on external API services.

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Basic Integration ‚úÖ
- [x] Add Ollama as a dependency (`bun add ollama`)
- [x] Create a wrapper module for LLM operations in `src/utils/llm-processor.ts`
- [x] Implement basic content extraction functionality
- [x] Add proper timeout and connection handling

#### Phase 2: Structured Data Extraction ‚úÖ
- [x] Develop schema-based extraction using Ollama's chat feature
- [x] Add prompt templates for different extraction scenarios
- [x] Implement JSON parsing and validation of LLM outputs
- [x] Handle both well-formatted JSON and embedded JSON in responses

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [x] Content summarization for crawled pages
- [ ] Content classification (categorize pages by topic)
- [ ] Entity extraction (people, organizations, locations)
- [ ] Sentiment analysis

### User-Configurable Options ‚úÖ
- [x] Model selection (different Ollama models)
- [x] Custom prompts for extraction
- [x] Adjustable parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.)
- [x] Fallback strategies for failed extractions
- [x] Timeout configuration for LLM operations

## Performance Improvements

- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large crawls
- [ ] Implement stream processing for large outputs
- [ ] Add support for distributed crawling
- [ ] Implement resume functionality for interrupted crawls

## Integrations

- [ ] Storage integrations (local filesystem)
- [ ] Database integrations (Sqlite, PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Vector database support for semantic search
- [x] Integration with local LLMs for extraction

## Documentation

- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Usage guides
- [x] Examples for common use cases
- [ ] FAQ and troubleshooting

## Priority Tasks

1. ~~Implement structured data extraction with Ollama~~ ‚úÖ
2. Add screenshot capability
3. Support for authentication
4. Add interactive page actions
5. Implement webhook support
